# Loan Approval 

### Information
Borrowers use a loan application to apply for a loan. Borrowers give important financial information to the lender via the loan application. The loan application is critical in determining whether or not the lender will approve the request for funds or credit.


### Purpose
The goal of this ML project is to create an ML model and web application that the bank can use to determine whether or not a user is eligible for a loan.
