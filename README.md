# Loan Approval Prediction

### Content
A loan application is used by borrowers to apply for a loan. Through the loan application, borrowers reveal key details about their finances to the lender. The loan application is crucial to determining whether the lender will grant the request for funds or credit.

### Problem Statement
The director of SZE bank identified that going through the loan applications to filter the people who can be granted loans or need to be rejected is a tedious and time-consuming process. He wants to automate it and increase his bankâ€™s efficiency. After talking around a bit, your name pops up as one of the few data scientists who can make this possible within a limited time. Will you help the director out? 

### Objective
The idea behind this ML project is to build an ML model and web application that the bank can use to classify if a user can be granted a loan or not.

### Web template
For the machine learning deployment, this app uses HTML and CSS templates of [colorlib](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/colorlib-regform-7/)
